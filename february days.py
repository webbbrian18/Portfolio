# 16. February Days
# The month of February normally has 28 days. 
# But if it is a leap year, February has 29 days. 
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a year. 
# The program should then display the number of days 
# in February that year. Use the following criteria to 
# identify leap years:
# 
# 1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. 
# If it is, then it is a leap year if and only if it is 
# also divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, 
# but 2100 is not.
# 
# 2. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a 
# leap year if and only if it is divisible by 4. For 
# example, 2008 is a leap year, but 2009 is not.
# 
# Here is a sample run of the program:
# 
# Enter a year: 2008 Enter
# In 2008 February has 29 days.

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
message = ""

if year > 0:
    #Valid
    message = "In " + format(year) + " February has "

    if year % 100 == 0:
        # might be leap
        if year % 400 == 0:
            message += "29"
        else:
            message += "28"
    else:
        # might be leap
        if year % 4 == 0:
            message += "29"
        else:
            message += "28"

    message += " days."

else:
    #Invalid
    message = "Enter a year greater that 0\n" + \
              "Rerun the program and try again."

print(message)
