# 9. Roulette Wheel Colors
#
# On a roulette wheel, the pockets are numbered 
# from 0 to 36. The colors of the pockets are
# as follows:
#
# • Pocket 0 is green.
# • For pockets 1 through 10, the odd-numbered 
#   pockets are red and the even-numbered pockets are black.
# • For pockets 11 through 18, the odd-numbered pockets 
#   are black and the even-numbered pockets are red.
# • For pockets 19 through 28, the odd-numbered pockets 
#   are red and the even-numbered pockets are black.
# • For pockets 29 through 36, the odd-numbered pockets 
#   are black and the even-numbered pockets are red.
#
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a pocket number 
# and displays whether the pocket is green, red, or black. 
# The program should display an error message if the user 
# enters a number that is outside the range of 0 through 36.
